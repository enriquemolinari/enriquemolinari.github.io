        <title>Object Oriented Frameworks: Concepts, White Box and Black Box Examples</title>
        <description>
          
          When teaching Object Oriented Frameworks (usually in Advanced Object Oriented Programming courses) there is a challenge for students to understand their nature, differences with libraries and the difference between white box frameworks vs black box frameworks. In this post I will start talking very briefly about general concepts of frameworks....

        <title>Software Architecture vs Software Design</title>
        <description>

Of course, I did not read all the books about software Architecture available in the market, but I read two great books, which I recommend (mentioned on footnotes below), but neither of them, IMHO, are...

        <title>A Note on the Definition of Legacy Code</title>
        <description>

        <title>What is the role of a Software Architect ?</title>
        <description>
