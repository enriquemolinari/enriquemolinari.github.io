          Here is my third book. Did you know that with PWAs you can create Web Apps that deliver a user experience similar to native apps? Did you know that with the React tooling most of the work to create them is almost done? I will explain how to create PWAs...

          Here is my second book. Learn how to code applications in React by following a solid path that starts by studying essential JavaScript constructions to then go into React core concepts to finally write an application. Understand how to split an application into components (class or function-based ones), how to...

          I have just released my first book about hands-on Software Architecture. If you want to know how to design and code an application with Modular Architecture, or with Layered Architecture or with Hexagonal Architecture (Clean Architecture), or with Microservice Architecture this book is for you. If you are a developer...

        <title>Object Oriented Frameworks: Concepts, White Box and Black Box Examples</title>
        <description>
          
          When teaching Object Oriented Frameworks (usually in Advanced Object Oriented Programming courses) there is a challenge for students to understand their nature, differences with libraries and the difference between white box frameworks vs black box frameworks. In this post I will start talking very briefly about general concepts of frameworks....

        <title>Lambda Expressions in Java, a Concrete Example</title>
        <description>
          
          Maybe you have read several posts on the web on how Lambda Expressions are used. Most of the ones I have read uses examples for filtering collections with the new Stream API of Java 8. Those examples are good but they are more focused on showing a fancy way of...

        <title>Use Inheritance Properly</title>
        <description>
          
          How many times did you ask yourself, in order to avoid duplicated code, if you should use inheritance or composition? Did you ask yourself about the differences between subtype and subclass? Do you always follows the Liskov Substitution Principle? This post will try to help to answer these questions. And...

        <title>Please, use the debugguer</title>
        <description>
          
          I have found, during my experience (which is far from large one) working with other developers, that few of them use the debugger as the first tool for troubleshooting and learning or understand legacy code. If you are familiar with Java/Eclipse, you will know that debugging an application is pretty...

        <title>Software Architecture vs Software Design</title>
        <description>
          
          I cannot find in the literature a precise distinction between Software Architecture and Software Design. Of course, I did not read all the books about software Architecture available in the market, but I read two great books, which I recommend (mentioned on footnotes below), but neither of them, IMHO, are...

        <title>A Note on the Definition of Legacy Code</title>
        <description>
          
          Many developers think that Legacy Code is an old code base that they inherit. A working application that other developer or other team wrote and you inherit it to maintain or enhance or to migrate to a newer platform. This is not entirely true, according to the definition of Michael...

        <title>What is the role of a Software Architect ?</title>
        <description>
          
          If you are an Architect you may have discovered that you are not going to be asked to spend all your time on improving the design of an existing software product, nor to write code for an specific project. As soon as you become an Architect, your meetingâ€™s calendar will...
